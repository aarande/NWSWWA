# NWSWWA

This is a Python library to decode National Weather Service warnings and advisories. It relies heavily on previous work done by Daryl Herzmann on the pyIEM project (https://github.com/akrherz/pyIEM)
and is intended to build upon his work and make a standalone Python library for all.

**This is a work in progress and is not even alpha stage at this time**
